# domains

Vehicle - avoid obstacles to reach a goal with safe bunkers
GridWorld - simple obstacles to reach a goal

# algorithms

A* - off-line full search algorithm
LSS-LRTA* - well-known real time search algorithm
SZero - incorporating safety into LSS-LRTA* by backing up safety through parent pointers
